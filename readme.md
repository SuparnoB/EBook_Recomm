We've always conisdered the magical persona books seem to hold, and with this notebook, we step out on a journey to see what kind of books really drives people to read in this era of modern smart devices.

With such a vast, overwhelming number of factors, we'll go over such demographics:

Does any relationship lie between ratings and the total ratings given?
1. Where do majority of the books lie, in terms of ratings - Does reading a book really bring forth bias for the ratings?
2. Do authors tend to perform same over time, with all their newer books? 
3. Or do they just fizzle out. Do number of pages make an impact on reading styles, ratings and popularity? 
4. Can books be recommended based on ratings? Is that a factor which can work?
